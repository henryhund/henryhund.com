		<p>I will list some of my favorite homebrew recipes here, in Brewsmith 2.0 format. If I've adapted the recipe from somewhere else I will include that info in the recipe notes (along with any tasting and brew notes).</p>
		<ul class="Message" style="font-size:13px;">
		<li><a href="assets/homebrew/Johns Red Ale.bsmx" class="Message">John's Red Ale</a> - one of the best hoppy red session beers I've ever brewed or tasted</li>
		<li><a href="assets/homebrew/A Serious Tripel.bsmx" class="Message">A Serious Tripel</a> - a delicious and strong (9-10% ABV) Belgian. This one has been in the fermenter undisturbed for a while...except for when I've stolen a taste or two</li>
		<li><a href="assets/homebrew/Hopslam Clone.bsmx" class="Message">Hopslam Clone</a> - Perhaps better than the original beer that inspired it. Delicious and drinkable. Could benefit from more dryhopping/late hop additions</li>
		<li><a href="assets/homebrew/SMASH 1 Maris Simcoe.bsmx" class="Message">SMaSH #1: Maris Simcoe</a> - Fun place to start for experimentation with SMaSH beers. I'll actually be making this one soon</li>
		<li><a href="assets/homebrew/Black Black IIPA.bsmx" class="Message">Black Black IIPA</a> - I've really been into Black IPAs recently. Targeting a spring release for this one</li>
		<li><a href="assets/homebrew/Hot Chocolate Porter.bsmx" class="Message">Hot Chocolate Porter</a> - I adapted this from a BYO recipe, but it didn't turn out so great. BYO seemed to love it...I brewed it last year for Valentine's Day and I still have a handful of bottles left. Let me know how it turns out if you try it</li>
		</ul>
		<p>I will be adding more soon...but that's it for now. <a class="Message" href="mailto.php">Let me know what you think</a>!</p>
