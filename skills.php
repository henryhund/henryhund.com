		<p>I've long been interested in technology and programming, dating back to when I taught myself PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS and Javascript in 2003 (my junior year of high school). Though I spent the last few years in finance, I am studying tech and entrepreneurship at <a href="http:///www.wharton.upenn.edu" class="Message">Wharton</a> so that I might be a more successful entrepreneur or a better contributor to a startup as a product manager, business intelligence analyst, marketer, or anything else.</p>

		<ul class="Message" style="font-size:13px;">
		<li>I graduated college in 2008 with a major in <a href="http://www.ist.psu.edu" class="Message" target="_blank">Information Sciences and Technology</a> from the <a href="http://www.shc.psu.edu" class="Message" target="_blank">Schreyer Honors College</a> of Penn State. After graduation I spent four years in finance before returning to school to earn my MBA at Wharton.</li>
		<li>I've always "worn a lot of hats," especially during my most recent job as a member of the investment team of a young, small and growing financial advisor to endowments and foundations. I hope to continue this by contributing across functions at a tech startup.</li>
		<li>At Wharton, I am studying tech, innovation, entrepreneurship, leadership, marketing, new product management, operations, statistics and finance. I plan to take formal classes next semester on data mining and analytics, market research, VC finance and negotiations. I am also a consultant serving small businesses in Philadelphia for the <a href="http://whartonsbdc.wharton.upenn.edu/" class="Message" target="_blank">Wharton Small Business Development Center</a>, and I am completing a market research project in partnership with the Microsoft Xbox strategy group that I will present to Microsoft senior leadership this spring.</li>
		<li>During my spare time, I am refreshing my tech and coding knowledge by handwriting this (simple) personal site in PHP, Javascript and HTML using Sublime; learning the fundamentals of Ruby on Rails, Django and Python (not proficient with these...but I one day hope to be!); testing Tableau and R; and playing with mixpanel and Google Analytics.</li>
		<li>In college, I programmed portions of the web functionality powering <a href="http://www.thon.org" class="Message" target="_blank">THON</a>. In high school, I built a award-winning custom CMS in PHP and MySQL for my school newspaper.</li>
		<li>And though I am no longer a programming "black-belt," I'm confident I know enough to be dangerous...</li>
		</ul>
